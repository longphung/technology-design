However, a specialisation is an area of interest not an accredited major."
What is a pre-requisite?,"A pre-requisite subject is a subject or sequence of subjects which must be completed before choosing a subsequent unit or course. For example, an undergraduate student cannot choose postgraduate units at Swinburne Online."
What is a PhD?,"A Doctor of Philosophy, or PhD, is a globally recognised qualification that’s considered the highest postgraduate achievement an individual can earn. To be awarded with a PhD, you must select a specific subject within your chosen field, carry out extensive and original research and submit a substantial thesis on your findings. Your thesis will be assessed by external examiners and will be judged on the quality of original research and contribution to the knowledge of the subject.

You’ll be required to commit to three or four years of full-time study (or part-time equivalent) and will be supervised by academic staff members. Once you graduate, you’ll be eligible to teach in your chosen field at a university level or work in a specialised position."
What is a Masters Degree?,"A Masters Degree allows you to become a specialist in your chosen field. Typically students are required you to demonstrate a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice. When you graduate, you’ll possess advanced knowledge of a specialised body of theoretical and applied topics, high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently. You will generally be required to undertake academic coursework and in some cases, preparation for professional practice."
What is a major unit?,"A major unit refers to what ‘specialisation’ you would like to focus on within your degree. For example, as a Bachelor of Business Administration student, you may wish to major in a specialisation area such as marketing. For current students, more information can be found in theStudy Resourcessection of our Student Portal."
What is a Graduate Diploma?,"A Graduate Diploma will allow you to complete specialisation studies in a smaller amount of time and at a reduced cost of a Masters degree. Most of the time you will also have the option of transferring to a masters degree in the same topic. Once you complete your graduate diploma, you’ll have advanced knowledge and skills for professional, highly skilled work or further learning."
What is a Graduate Certificate?,"Completing a Graduate Certificate will help you upgrade your qualifications or give you advanced practical skills required in specialist industries. If you haven’t earned a bachelor degree, many programs may allow you entry provided you have sufficient relevant work experience in your chosen field. Graduate Certificates generally require a commitment of six months full-time study, or an equivalent part-time commitment."
What is a Grade Point Average (GPA)?,"A GPA is a calculation for higher education results. There are two GPA scales commonly used in Australia and overseas, the four-point and the seven-point scale. These scales differ in the grade points that they allocate to each grade but the method of calculation is the same. Swinburne uses a four-point method. To find out how to calculate a GPA visit our Grade Point Average page."
What is a good option for upskilling during this time?,"The best study option for you will depend on your current level of education, as well as the amount of available time you have to commit. For those looking to step up and earn a promotion or just upskill in general, ashort coursemight be the best choice.

AGraduate Certificateis also a good option for anyone looking to be educated over a short period of time.

What is a Double Degree?,"A double degree is a university degree where you study two single degrees at the same time, giving you the option of specialising in two different fields. To be eligible to enrol in a double degree, you must meet all the entry requirements of both degree programs. Even though you’ll be doubling your opportunities and giving yourself more career flexibility once you graduate, a double degree generally doesn’t take double the time to complete.

In most instances, you’ll benefit from cross-crediting elective units, which will reduce your study costs and time compared to if you were studying separate bachelor degrees at different times. Usually a double degree will take four years full time study or part-time equivalent."
What is a Diploma?,"Completing a Diploma or Advanced Diploma certificate will give you practical skills for work as well as the opportunity to progress to another qualification. At Swinburne, you’ll be taught by experienced teachers and have access to equipment used in industry to help prepare you for your future."
What is a Commonwealth Supported Place?,"The Australian Government subsidises an Australian citizen student’s education by giving them a Commonwealth supported place. By doing this they are paying part of the course fees directly to the university and the student pays the remainder. If you are a domestic undergraduate student, you are eligible for a Commonwealth supported place."
What is a Certificate?,"Certificates are the most basic qualification available to secondary school students and beyond. Offered by TAFEs, Community Education Centres and Registered Training Providers, Certificates I, II, III and IV will prepare you for employment or further education and training.Certificate I:Will give you skills when beginning a profession or help you gain community involvement.Certificate II:You’ll build on knowledge and skills to work in a defined context and undertake further learning.Certificate III:You’ll learn more in-depth theoretical and practical skills for work or further learning.Certificate IV:You’ll learn theoretical and practical skills for specialised work or further learning."
What is a Bachelor Degree?,"Bachelor degrees are offered by universities and are presented to you when you complete an undergraduate course of study. Depending on the field of study, the duration of the degree can range from three to five years of full-time study (or part-time equivalent). Most bachelor degrees are recognised worldwide. A Bachelor degree teaches you skills such as research and analytical thinking and is recognised as a higher qualification to diplomas or certificates. Where a Diploma will give you the skills you need for your job, a Bachelor will set you up for your career."
What happens if I don’t pay my fees on time?,"It is your responsibility to ensure that your enrolment is correct prior to the due date. If you do not pay your fees by the due date you may be cancelled from your degree. If you withdraw from a unit after the due date you will receive a fail result on your student record.
